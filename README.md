# ML-Project-4-Fake-News-Prediction
This project aims to detect fake news articles using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of news articles, which includes both fake and real news.

# Features
Data Collection: Acquires a dataset of news articles labeled as fake or real from Kaggle
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the text data for analysis.
Model Training: Used Logistic Regression to train a fake news detection model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.

# Requirements
Python 3.8+
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
nltk
jupyter (for development and testing)
A labeled dataset of fake and real news articles
