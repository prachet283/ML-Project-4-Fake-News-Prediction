And it looked stoned.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nIn the week or so since his death last Monday, Mr. Petty has been memorialized as carrying some kind of classic-rock baton, which came as a surprise to me since all my first encounters with him happened on MTV. That\\u2019s a rock-critic distinction. And it makes sense for the purists to lay their claim. Mr. Petty has never sounded out of place in a block crammed with, say, \\u201cStairway to Heaven,\\u201d \\u201cHotel California\\u201d and \\u201cLegs.\\u201d But Mr. Petty belonged as much to MTV, alongside Duran Duran and Cyndi Lauper, as he did to the old-guard rigidity of whatever is meant by \\u201cclassic rock.\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s true, there was a classicism to his approach to rock, whether he was on his own, recording with the Heartbreakers or with the Traveling Wilburys, a sort of rock-historical Avengers. But his elasticity and economy (a Tom Petty song rarely made it past the four-minute mark) and the sweet spot it deeply satisfied over and over, were hallmarks of pop.\\nMr. Petty\\u2019s nuttiest contribution to the video era was \\u201cDon\\u2019t Come Around Here No More,\\u201d from 1985. It riffs on the Mad Hatter\\u2019s tea party from \\u201cAlice in Wonderland\\u201d with Mr. Petty as the Hatter. The props (edible teacups, mushroom tuffets) and costumes were surreally proportioned and druggie. Mr. Petty briefly either shrinks inside his outfit or his clothes turn enormous. But what\\u2019s freaky about the clip is what a creep he pretends to be, leaping from one end of the enormous dining table to where Alice sits at the other and appearing to chase her around the checkerboard set.\\nEventually, she\\u2019s trapped in the teacup and her body turns into a cake that the band and the Hatter all find good enough to eat. So they hack into her. In the final shot, the camera pans from a screaming Alice to a close-up of Mr. Petty gobbling her up. He wears the same bemused expression the entire time and, courtesy of his sunglasses, never lets you see his eyes. He was opium-den Willy Wonka. It was a look he\\u2019d often return to.\\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.

Michael Jackson was a werewolf-zombie. Madonna rolled around in gondolas. Prince did splits. Tom Petty ate people. I always found that funny given how little his face appeared to do. You\\u2019d watch these videos and wonder how such a pleasingly distinctive sound could come out of a mouth that never seemed to open.\\nMr. Petty\\u2019s approach to being on MTV was not to take it more seriously than he had to. His sense of frivolity came with a coating of stranger-danger. \\u201cI Won\\u2019t Back Down\\u201d kicks off with him, still outfitted like the Mad Hatter, lifting the lid of a gift box. The camera peers inside, revealing Mr. Petty and a band playing the song on a stark, black set. Before the guitars start to cry and chug, there\\u2019s a natural studio silence that always terrified me. Who knows why? But some of it is the dark-magician he\\u2019d styled himself as.\\nThe hat and the shades seemed to keep him in disguise. It took a long time to remember that when his career in music videos started \\u2014 with \\u201cRefugee,\\u201d to pick one hypnotically shabby-looking performance \\u2014 he looked like the average girl\\u2019s prom date: cuter than you thought. By the time of \\u201cInto the Great Wide Open,\\u201d from 1991, Mr. Petty wore another ridiculous hat and wire-rimmed glasses. This time the Mad Hatter was an omniscient narrator of the song\\u2019s music-biz blues. It\\u2019s an imaginative, fitfully humorous literalizing of the song. Johnny Depp plays Eddie, a clich\\u00e9 rock star, and Faye Dunaway has a ball portraying his back-stabbed manager. (Mr. Petty himself takes on about four different parts.) The music-video veteran Julian Temple directed it, and he worked with a poignant tinge of bloat. Accordingly to Mr. Petty, in Peter Bogdanovich\\u2019s exhaustingly thorough documentary, \\u201cRunnin\\u2019 Down a Dream,\\u201d Mr. Temple originally shot a 17-minute version.\\nThe videos got at a kind of truth about Mr. Petty. Lots of his songs featured power contests between himself and unspecified forces, like record labels. Commands like \\u201cdon\\u2019t,\\u201d \\u201cwon\\u2019t,\\u201d \\u201cstop\\u201d and \\u201cquit\\u201d recur. Maybe some of the clips were a fantasy of a straightforward control he struggled for in his music. Of course, as a listener, you often heard struggle\\u2019s opposite. You felt the joy of the music\\u2019s thrum and jangle. The songs took three-chord structure and made little origami. In videos, he never seemed impressed.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nThat was the other thing about them. Watching them was an exercise in cognitive dissonance. For the dramatization of the ecstasy a listener feels hearing a Tom Petty song, you had to go to the movies. You had to see Tom Cruise, in Cameron Crowe\\u2019s \\u201cJerry Maguire,\\u201d searching a car radio for a song that matched his money-loving mood, settling on \\u201cFree Fallin.\\u2019\\u201d It\\u2019s one of the most casually human things Mr. Cruise has done in a movie. He practically hits the roof of his car by the time the chorus comes around.\\nJerry, of course, is hearing the bright side of a song whose sense of loneliness never occurs to Mr. Cruise. But the movie gets the irony that, really, Jerry is, Wile E. Coyote, out of road to run.\\nThen there\\u2019s Brooke Smith in Jonathan Demme\\u2019s \\u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\\u201d rocking out to \\u201cAmerican Girl.\\u201d There\\u2019s only one way to experience this song, and Smith\\u2019s is it: pounding on the steering wheel. Mr. Petty really is one of those artists who makes you feel like you could drive a car forever. Smith\\u2019s character is about to be beaten unconscious, trapped in a van and made to live at the bottom of a dry well. But for a brief moment, she\\u2019s happy, feeling the opposite of what Mr. Petty\\u2019s song is actually about: letdowns.\\nThat, of course, was his cleverness as a writer. He wrote major-key bummers. A listener didn\\u2019t know what was hitting him until he knew. Obviously, Mr. Petty knew. The young me was never ready for those old Petty videos. To a kid, that Wile E. Coyote feeling describes a cartoon. For everybody else, it\\u2019s just life.\",\n          \"European officials are increasingly trying to counter that narrative.\\nOn Wednesday, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\\u2019s competition commissioner, ordered Luxembourg to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon. The ruling was tied to an agreement between the country and the company that the European Commission, the bloc\\u2019s executive arm, said dated to 2003.\\nThe order resembles a similar move the commission made last year, when it directed Ireland to reclaim around $15.2 billion from Apple.\\nIreland fears that such a decision could make it a less attractive place for multinational companies. In a sign of the disquiet in Dublin about that order, the Irish government failed to meet a January deadline to collect the money. It has appealed the ruling.\\nThat earned Ireland a forceful rebuke from Ms. Vestager.\\nA year later, \\u201cIreland has not recovered any money, not even in part,\\u201d she said, warning the country to accelerate its efforts to avoid \\u201cmore conflictual waters,\\u201d a reference to the prospects for a lengthy court battle.\\nAlthough litigation to force Ireland to recoup the taxes could drag on for years, the commission has successfully sued countries in the past and punished them with large fines for failing to recover money from companies that received illegal state aid.\\nAt the time of the ruling, Europe\\u2019s competition watchdogs said that Apple\\u2019s arrangements with Dublin were illegal and had ensured the iPhone maker paid virtually nothing on its European business in some years. Brussels argued that the deals allowed Apple to funnel profit from two Irish subsidiaries to an office in which it had \\u201cno employees, no premises, no real activities.\\u201d\\nThe Irish Department of Finance said that it \\u201chas never accepted the commission\\u2019s analysis\\u201d in the Apple case and that it was taken aback by Ms. Vestager\\u2019s decision to take the country to court. The department said it had \\u201cmade significant progress on this complex issue\\u201d and accused the European authorities of taking a \\u201cwholly unnecessary step.\\u201d\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\nApple did not immediately comment on the latest move, but has criticized the ruling in the past.

The arrangement essentially capped the amount of tax that the retailer paid, and relied on a method known as transfer pricing.\\nTypically, transfer pricing has been used by companies to assign revenues and profits to different business units depending on their location, role in the overall company and assets. But that system is harder to police with technology companies because many of their biggest assets, like intellectual property, are intangible. The European Commission said that Amazon had abused this system by sending most of its European revenue to a Luxembourg subsidiary that was not liable to pay corporate tax, helping the company cut its overall bill.\\nMs. Vestager said the arrangement had \\u201cno valid economic justification\\u201d and that the company had been able to \\u201cavoid taxation on almost three quarters of the profits it made from all Amazon sales in the E.U.\\u201d\\nAmazon and Luxembourg have denied the charges.\\n\\u201cWe believe that Amazon did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg,\\u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that it \\u201cpaid tax in full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law.\\u201d\\nAmazon said it would study the commission\\u2019s ruling and was considering whether to appeal.\\nIn a statement, Luxembourg\\u2019s finance ministry also contested Ms. Vestager\\u2019s ruling. \\u201cAs Amazon has been taxed in accordance with the tax rules applicable at the relevant time, Luxembourg considers that the company has not been granted incompatible state aid,\\u201d it said.\\nIt is not illegal in the European Union for member states to attempt to lure businesses by lowering corporate tax rates. But, as with Amazon\\u2019s agreement with Luxembourg, offering special deals to select companies that are not made available to rivals can amount to \\u201cillegal state aid.\\u201d\\nThe investigations are among several in which commission officials have looked into the affairs of Silicon Valley companies. Regulators in Brussels are challenging Google and Qualcomm over alleged antitrust violations, and officials in various countries have investigated Facebook over its handling of customers\\u2019 data.\\nMs. Vestager has made taxes a priority of her term as Europe\\u2019s competition commissioner. In that time, she has penalized Starbucks in the Netherlands and Anheuser-Busch InBev in Belgium. But Luxembourg has been a particular target: In 2015, she told the country to claw back about \\u20ac30 million from a Fiat Chrysler unit, while a case considering Luxembourg\\u2019s treatment of McDonald\\u2019s is also continuing.\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think that we\\u2019re done,\\u201d Ms. Vestager said on Wednesday, adding that new laws were also necessary. \\u201cThe main part of the solution is of course that we have legislation that gives you a transparent tax landscape and enables national tax authorities to do their job.\\u201d\\nA broader overhaul may be afoot. The European Commission published proposals last month under which internet companies would be taxed in the countries where they generated revenue. Such a shift would mean the companies could not move their profits to jurisdictions with lower taxes.\\nA push in that direction could, however, prove complicated and carries several risks, said Clemens Fuest, the director of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research, a prominent think tank in Germany. In particular, European governments still might devise a host of new incentives to lure investment, while legislative changes at the European level could prompt retaliation by major trading partners.\\n\\u201cThere are real dangers if Brussels keeps acting unilaterally,\\u201d Mr. Fuest said.\\nThe European Union stepped up efforts to curb tax avoidance by companies and by individuals after the financial crisis, which forced many of the bloc\\u2019s member states to cut public services and raise tax rates. But opponents of the austerity programs argued that big corporations had not faced the same pressures, partly because they have long been able to shift their profits to low-tax countries.\"\n

REUTERS/David Becker\\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain hopes a provisional U.S. ruling imposing tariffs on Canadian aerospace manufacturer Bombardier (BBDb.TO) will not be politically influenced when new evidence is considered, UK Business Secretary Greg Clark said on Tuesday.\\nClark said he was confident the British government could successfully fight the complaint, which was brought by Boeing (BA.N) and could cost jobs in the British province of Northern Ireland.\\n\\u201cFollowing the initial determination, there is then a further call for evidence ... we look to the U.S. to make sure that this is a rigorous process and is not politically influenced,\\u201d Clark told lawmakers.\\nThe U.S. Commerce Department has raised proposed trade duties on Bombardier CSeries jets to nearly 300 percent, backing Boeing\\u2019s complaint that the Canadian company received illegal subsidies and dumped the planes at \\u201cabsurdly low\\u201d prices.\\nThe decision could effectively halt sales of Bombardier\\u2019s new plane to U.S. airlines by quadrupling the cost of the jets imported to the United States, although Clark said the jet did not directly compete with Boeing\\u2019s aircraft.\\nBritain's Business Secretary, Greg Clark, arrives for a meeting in Downing Street in central London, Britain October 9, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville\\nClark said British Prime Minister Theresa May had twice discussed the dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump, and that several members of the British government had reinforced their \\u201cserious concerns\\u201d with the U.S. administration over the ruling.\\nHe added Britain would discuss the ruling with the United States, Canada and the two companies in the coming days.\\nBombardier is the largest manufacturing employer in Northern Ireland, and the decision to impose duties on the planes has put 4,200 jobs at risk.\\nBut Britain is also a major base for Boeing. The company has recently begun constructing its first European parts manufacturing site in Sheffield, northern England, and Britain has warned that Boeing might miss out on future business over the row.\\n\\u201cBoeing has a reputation in this country that was beginning to grow in a positive way, through the investment in Sheffield and elsewhere,\\u201d Clark said.\\n\\u201cTo jeopardize that reputation and relationship by doing something that is completely unjustified is something that I don\\u2019t regard as being in the strategic interests of Boeing.\\u201d\",\n          \"Colin Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since March when he opted out of his San Francisco 49ers contract\\n\\\"This is what lynchings look like in 2016.\\\"\\nA video accompanies Colin Kaepernick's Instagram post.

He points it to the man's chest, and fires.\\nAlton Sterling, 37, died of gunshot wounds to the chest and back.\\nFormer San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first protested against racial injustice and police brutality by kneeling down during the United States national anthem in the summer of 2016. Since then, a whole movement has grown around that gesture.\\nBBC Sport's Richard Conway, David Lockwood and Simon Clancy travelled to the US to investigate. Listen again to BBC Radio 5 live's programme, On Bended Knee, and watch a special Newsnight report.\\n\\\"Another murder in the streets because of the colour of a man's skin, at the hands of the people who they say will protect us,\\\" Kaepernick writes.\\n\\\"When will they be held accountable?\\\"\\nThe next day, 6 July 2016, another black man is shot dead by a police officer.\\nPhilando Castile, 32, is shot seven times during a traffic stop.

The Kaepernicks had two young sons who died because of heart defects. They wanted another child.\\nTheir boy grew up to become a superstar, and one of the most divisive figures in the United States.\\nAt high school he was a brilliant baseball pitcher, but the NFL was his focus. He could throw the ball. A quarterback.\\nKaepernick posted this photo with his mum Teresa with the caption: \\\"She showed me how my heart was supposed to radiate! Love you!\\\"\\nFirst, he had to reach the college game. It wasn't easy. Scouts from the University of Nevada - the only one to eventually offer him a scholarship - watched the clips his older brother had burned to DVD, but even they were not convinced.\\nThey took a gamble because they saw him dominate a high-school basketball game he really should have missed, having been struck down with fever the same day.\\nHe went to college. He studied for a degree in business management, excelled on the pitch, and opened his curious mind wide to the world.\\nDr Reginald Stewart spent 19 years at the University of Nevada, and knew Kaepernick during his time there.\\nHe told USA Today: \\\"He is very, very smart and very intellectual. He's a very deep thinker. What he's doing is absolutely and directly in line with how he's always communicated.\\n\\\"It's not like I turned on the TV and was like: 'Wow, where did this come from?' I was like, you know what, he has been thinking about these issues for at least the time I've known him. At some point, he made the decision that this was important enough for him to act.\\\"\\nKaepernick is drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in 2011. He leads them to the Super Bowl two years later, but they lose to the Baltimore Ravens.\\nHe continues to read widely - about the civil rights movement and post-colonial theory, Malcom X's autobiography and Franz Fanon's The Wretched Of The Earth.\\nHe begins to attend classes at the University of California, Berkeley, having befriended Ameer Hasan Loggins, who is working towards his doctorate in African Diaspora Studies.\\nIn August, Loggins wrote an article for The Athletic about their relationship. He compared Kaepernick to Ella Baker, the civil rights activist who died in 1986, aged 83.\\n\\\"She was a civil/human rights leader that was invested in developing a leaderful movement,\\\" Loggins wrote. \\\"She pushed the folks to politicise and mobilise the people via group-centred leadership.\\n\\\"Here I am, taking leadership cues from Ella Baker, and next thing I know I am in the inner circle of a passionate, intelligent and conscious NFL star with a tremendous heart and a righteous indignation over the treatment of the oppressed.\\n\\\"I met Kaepernick before he became a cultural icon and a lightning rod for both hope and hatred.\\n\\\"People that trace our connection to UC Berkeley assume he became politicised in my class. But Colin was aware, focused, well-read, eager to learn.\\\"\\nAnd then came three days in July last year.\\nThe perilous fight\\nThe singer pauses, hanging between verses. He knows - like the thousands standing around him in the stands, on the pitch and on the stage - that the Star-Spangled Banner, the American national anthem, is about to reach its highest point.\\nKaepernick is on the team bench. Sandwiched between two giant soft-drink barrels, he sits alone as thousands roar and whoop in appreciation.\\n\\\"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way,\\\" he says after the pre-season match in August 2016.\\n\\\"There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\\\"\\nKaepernick, with his shirt number slightly obscured, is by the orange drinks cart\\nThis is not his first protest. But it is his first protest in team kit. And it is the first time he is asked about it.\\nHis silent, solitary gesture of solidarity makes a lot of people very angry. One of those is Nate Boyer. He used to be in the US Army Special Forces and is a former NFL player.\\n\\\"When I saw that, I felt like I was betrayed. It just hurt. It was extremely disgraceful for me. In my eyes you might as well burn the flag,\\\" he told the BBC.\\n\\\"That was my initial reaction before I stopped and thought: 'What is he so upset about that he would want to protest the symbol of what our country stands for - which is freedom of rights?'\\\"\\nBoyer decides to write an open letter to Kaepernick. And they meet.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Colin Kaepernick 'has potential to be icon' - Nate Boyer\\nThe NFL star - in 2014 he signed a contract that would have been worth up to $126m (\\u00a395.8m) over six years - actually sends a taxi to take Boyer from San Diego to San Francisco, about an eight-hour drive along the California coast.\\n\\\"I wanted him to stand - but I wanted him to stand because he feels like we are going in the right direction, like things are changing,\\\" Boyer says of their meeting.\\n\\\"I wanted him to understand the implications of what he was doing, and he listened. That was important, because we are at a time when people just shake their fists instead of trying to fix something together. We reached a position of consensus.\\\"\\nA week later, Kaepernick protests again. This time he is joined by his team-mate Eric Reid, and both men kneel while the national anthem plays.\\nBoyer, (far right) stands with his hand on his heart as the anthem plays. Kaerpernick kneels with team-mate Eric Reid (left)\\nBoyer stands next to them. On the same night, at another match, Jeremy Lane of the Seattle Seahawks remains seated for the anthem. The movement is growing.\\n\\\"It took courage for him to sit initially. It took more courage to bend his position a little bit,\\\" Boyer adds.\\n\\\"I told him if they knelt I would be next to them with my hand on my heart, because I support your right to peacefully protest in this country. That is what I fought for.\\\"\\n'I guess that makes me a proud bitch!'\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Mr Trump attacked dissenting players at a rally in Alabama\\nIn late September, two matches in to the 2017 NFL season, President Donald Trump makes a speech.\\nHe says players who refuse to stand for the national anthem are \\\"sons of bitches\\\" who should be fired by their teams.\\nThe reaction to his words could not be more divided.\\nThere is support from many - who find the protest disrespectful - and there is condemnation from many others.\\nKaepernick's mother tweets: \\\"I guess that makes me a proud bitch!\\\"\\nNBA star LeBron James describes Trump as a \\\"bum\\\".\\nOver the weekend of 24-25 September, never before had the protest of refusing to stand during the national anthem attracted such attention. Scores of athletes, managers and coaches - across several sports - performed some kind of protest or gesture of solidarity while the national anthem played before their games.\\nSome linked arms, some stayed in the dressing room, many knelt. Travis Kelce of Kansas City Chiefs became the most prominent white player to kneel.\\n\\\"I will be proud of it until the day I die,\\\" he told BBC Sport.\\n\\\"Hopefully it creates talk and creates change. It's very important for this to actually become a change in society instead of it just being a badge on NFL players for making a protest.\\\"\\nBut players find themselves having to explain what their actions mean.\\nMany NFL supporters and the US public in general view the players as being unpatriotic, disrespectful of American values and/or the US military, and they agree with what Trump said.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Chiefs fans divided over players kneeling\\nOutside the stadiums, fans tell the BBC:\\n\\\"I'm 100% against it and 100% behind Trump. I don't come out to the football games to see political views. This is not the venue for the protest. I will boo them.\\\"\\n\\\"They need to respect the flag.\\\"\\n\\\"The message was never about the anthem, the message is about police brutality against African-Americans and that seems to have been lost.\\\"\\nEric Reid, who first kneeled with Kaepernick a year before, writes in the New York Times: \\\"It baffles me that our protest is still being misconstrued as disrespectful to the country, flag and military personnel. We chose it because it's exactly the opposite.\\n\\\"It has always been my understanding that the brave men and women who fought and died for our country did so to ensure that we could live in a fair and free society, which includes the right to speak out in protest.\\\"\\nBut Kaepernick himself is absent. Why?\\n'A prisoner of the moment'\\nTwo NFL players walk into a computer game shop. It's not a joke, this really happened:\\nKeith Marshall and Rob Kelley of the Washington Redskins were in Dulles, just outside the nation's capital, when they saw a young boy wearing Kaepernick's number seven San Francisco 49ers jersey. They complimented him on it.\\nIn conversation, the 10-year-old Jaden explains why he is there. He has been saving up for an Xbox, and is keeping tabs on the price - he can't yet afford it.\\nSo they buy it for him - with his grandma's permission of course.\\nJaden explains why he has a Kaepernick jersey.\\n\\\"I liked how he wasn't afraid to show what he thought. He risked getting fired, which was a big thing. I wouldn't even do that, but he did, and I really like him for standing out.\\n\\\"I don't know if people agree with it, but he just doesn't care what people say and that's inspired me and probably inspired other people.\\\"\\nMarshall and Kelley also bought Jaden a game - but it wasn't Madden, the official NFL computer game.\\nHad it been, Jaden would not have found his favourite player. Kaepernick is no longer in the game. In March, he opted out of his contract with the 49ers. He is now 29 years old and a free agent. But off the pitch, he is busy.\\n\\\"His family is probably able to do whatever they want, but not everybody is able to have the stuff that we have the luxury of having,\\\" said Kelley (right)\\nHe has been donating money to various charities and projects across the United States - he has pledged to donate $1m (\\u00a3750,000) in total - and has helped set up an educational campaign called Know Your Rights.\\nIn late September, Sports Illustrated published a front cover on how sport has united following Trump's speech.\\nThere was no Kaepernick there either.\\nHe is not injured, and should still be capable of performing at the highest level. He has not spoken to the media for months. There are reports that team owners are refusing to sign him - despite coaches wanting to.\\nNBA star Steph Curry was featured on the cover, after he said he would not accept an invitation to the White House. Trump later said Curry had been 'uninvited'.\\nColin Kaepernick was not featured on the front of this month's Sports Illustrated magazine\\nWhen he was asked about Kaepernick's omission from the Sports Illustrated front cover, Curry described him as \\\"a prisoner of the moment\\\".\\n\\\"That was terrible,\\\" he said. \\\"The real people who are understanding exactly what's going on and who's really been active and vocal and truly making a difference, if you don't have Kaepernick front and centre on that, something's wrong.\\\"\\nBoyer, who was there when Kaepernick 'took a knee' for the first time, has not spoken to him for a while either - not since the Super Bowl, in February.\\nHe says that \\\"there was never any falling out as such\\\", but he does worry about him \\\"being pulled so far in one direction that there is never going to be any room to grow and really move forward\\\".\\nHe believes Kaepernick \\\"may never play again\\\" but adds: \\\"I don't fear that, because he is in a much more important position now.\\n\\\"If he is able to embrace those who disagree with him and love them, much like Martin Luther King did, then Colin has the potential to be something like that.\\n\\\"He could be the face of something and really move this conversation forward - if he is willing to listen.\\n\\\"It is going to take swallowing of pride and humility, but I would rather see him move into this realm than play again, because he has been quiet for a long time.\\n\\\"We need you to be a part of this because you started this.\\\"\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Trump comments 'inflammatory' - Kraft\\nWhere will it end? Friday night football in 'Muck City'\\nGo past the Trump International golf course, past the country and polo club, past Twentymile Bend, and out into the sugarcane fields.\\nWelcome to Belle Glade. 'Her soil is her fortune.'\\nIt is a small agricultural town, inland from the opulent coastal resort of Palm Beach, where Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence is situated.\\nBelle Glade and its surrounding area is known as Muck City, population about 20,000. It is also a hotbed for American football talent.\\nGlades Central High School counts dozens of NFL players among its alumni\\nOn Friday night, 17-year-old Kortney Ware was among the Glades Central Raiders lining up to face a team from Lake Worth, down on the coast. They won 50-8. Before the match, as the anthem played, Ware took a knee.\\n\\\"I did it for the police brutality,\\\" he told BBC Sport's Richard Conway.\\n\\\"People have got to speak up. I am tired of seeing us black people killed, especially young people. Every day somebody black getting killed for little stuff. It's tough for us black people. So we're standing up.\\\"\\nSome schools in the United States have vowed to punish players who refuse to stand for the national anthem.\\nAnd on Tuesday, reports suggested NFL owners, at a league meeting next week, are planning to introduce rules to force players to stand.\\nThe Raiders' coach, Jessie Hester, himself a former NFL player, says he \\\"fully supports\\\" the protests, and his players' right to do the same.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device 'I'm sick of young black men being killed'\\n\\\"There are no better people to do it than stars,\\\" he adds.\\n\\\"There is social injustice in this country that we need to address and the guys in the NFL have a platform. People listen to them.\\n\\\"These players here will want them to continue to speak out and be heard, because that's the only way change can happen.\\\"\\nWare says Kaepernick was \\\"definitely\\\" an inspiration, and he hopes the influence of his kneel gesture will continue to grow.\\n\\\"A lot of people are doing it now. Even the managers doing it too. That's amazingly successful,\\\" he adds.\\n\\\"This will lead to better things, open people's eyes. We need even more people doing what we doing. Everybody speak up. Please. It's not always about the football.\\n\\\"It's supposed to be the land of the free.
